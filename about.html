    <p>Ward Wenholz is an Investment Advisor Representative with Sapphire Financial Strategies LLC in Missoula, Montana. Since 1981, Ward has helped individuals, families, business owners and retirees develop strategies for wealth creation and preservation.</p>

    <p>Ward is a Mentor of the Money Trax System: helping clients understand wealth transfers out of their "Circle of Wealth" un-knowingly or un-necessarily. He focuses on retirement and life insurance planning, supporting his advice with timely, accurate information and exceptional service. Combining openness with honesty and concern, Ward is a reliable professional with whom clients can be comfortable working.</p>

    <p>“Clients rely on my experience and training to help them correctly manage their circle of wealth,” says Ward. “Minimizing the effects of taxes and inflation is an important part of the process. I also help my clients choose appropriate retirement programs and life insurance products, designed to safeguard as well as enhance their assets. Accumulating wealth is only half the battle; it is just as important to protect what you have worked so hard to build.</p>

    <p>Ward is a member of Financial Services Institute. He and his wife, Nanette, make their home in Florence, Montana. In his leisure, Ward enjoys golf, golf, more golf, and traveling with Nanette.</p>
