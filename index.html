    <p>It is nearly impossible to develop the correct solution when you are having the wrong conversation.</p>
    <hr>

    <p>I believe there is more opportunity to serve my clients by helping them
    avoid the losses than by picking the winners.<p>

    <p>By helping my clients be more efficient, I can help them find the money
    necessary to answer the four toughest financial questions.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>What rate of return do you have to earn on your savings and investment
        dollars to be able to retire at your current standard of living and have
        your money last through your life expectancy?</li>
      <li>How much do you need to save on a monthly or annual basis to be able
        to retire at your current standard of living and your money last until
        life expectancy?</li>
      <li>Doing what you are currently doing, how long will you have to work to
        be able to retire and live your current lifestyle until life expectancy?</li>
      <li>If you donâ€™t do anything different than you are doing today, how much
        will you have to reduce your standard of living at retirement for your
        money to last to your life expectancy?</li>
    </ol>
